# 📊 Resume Tailor Tool - Business Overview

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Resume Tailor Tool** is an intelligent resume optimization system that automatically tailors resumes to specific job descriptions using AI-powered analysis and LaTeX-based document generation. The tool analyzes job descriptions, extracts key requirements, and restructures candidate resumes to maximize ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility and recruiter appeal—all while maintaining a professional, single-page format.

### **Problem Statement**

**Challenges Job Seekers Face**:
1. ⚠️ **Generic Resumes Get Rejected**: 75% of resumes never reach human recruiters due to ATS filtering
2. ⚠️ **Manual Tailoring is Time-Consuming**: Customizing resumes for each application takes 1-2 hours per job
3. ⚠️ **Missing Keywords = Auto-Rejection**: Even qualified candidates get filtered out for missing specific JD keywords
4. ⚠️ **Inconsistent Formatting**: Poor formatting leads to ATS parsing errors and immediate rejection
5. ⚠️ **No Data-Driven Optimization**: Candidates don't know which skills/achievements to emphasize

### **Our Solution**

**Resume Tailor Tool** automates the entire resume customization process:
- ✅ **AI-Powered JD Analysis**: Extracts keywords, requirements, and skill priorities from any job description
- ✅ **Intelligent Content Rewriting**: Rephrases experience bullets to incorporate JD-specific terminology naturally
- ✅ **Smart Skill Prioritization**: Reorganizes skills section to highlight most relevant technologies first
- ✅ **ATS Optimization**: Ensures single-page format with keyword density optimized for ATS algorithms
- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: Maintains factual accuracy while enhancing presentation
- ✅ **Batch Processing**: Tailor resumes for multiple jobs in minutes, not hours
