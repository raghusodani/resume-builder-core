Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.1in}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the {{POSITION_TITLE}} position at {{COMPANY_NAME}}. {{MISSION_STATEMENT}}

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Amazon Experience - Building at Scale:}

\vspace{0.1in}

Currently, as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Hyderabad, I design and develop scalable systems that serve 100,000+ daily users globally. I have hands-on experience with {{TECH_STACK}}, building end-to-end solutions from architecture design through deployment and monitoring. At Amazon, I architected a customer service platform using React with TypeScript frontends and Spring-based Java backends integrated with GraphQL APIs. This system handles high-traffic loads while maintaining reliability and performance—experience that directly translates to building production-grade applications at scale.

\vspace{0.1in}

One of my key projects involved building a data integration pipeline from DynamoDB to Amazon's Data Lake, incorporating transformation and validation layers to ensure data integrity across distributed systems. This work required deep understanding of system architecture, performance optimization, and cloud infrastructure—skills essential for {{SPECIFIC_MATCH_1}}.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Technical Leadership \& Delivery:}

\vspace{0.1in}

Beyond individual contributions, I've demonstrated technical leadership by leading a JDK17 migration campaign across 28 packages at Amazon. This initiative required coordinating with cross-functional teams, conducting thorough code reviews, and ensuring best practices across the organization. I take ownership of projects from conception to production, working closely with product managers, designers, and engineers to deliver measurable business impact.

\vspace{0.1in}

Prior to Amazon, I worked at MAQ Software where I led the migration of an enterprise application from AngularJS to React with TypeScript, achieving 30\% performance improvement through efficient architecture and optimization strategies. This experience taught me the importance of technical decision-making and balancing innovation with maintainability.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Why {{COMPANY_NAME}}:}

\vspace{0.1in}

{{SPECIFIC_MATCH_2}}

\vspace{0.1in}

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because it aligns with my experience building scalable, user-centric applications in fast-paced environments. My background in {{TECH_STACK}} and proven track record of delivering complex projects at Amazon position me to contribute immediately to your team's success.

\vspace{0.1in}

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my Amazon experience, technical skills, and collaborative approach can help drive {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s mission forward. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
