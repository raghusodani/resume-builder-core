Hiring Manager
Open Finance Analytics Team
Mastercard
India

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer II position within Mastercard's Open Finance Analytics team. As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Hyderabad, I develop high-quality, secure, scalable software solutions that serve 100,000+ daily users with a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, REST APIs, SQL, and software engineering best practices. I am intellectually curious, passionate about software optimization, and a proven team player excited about the opportunity to drive Mastercard's products forward through consistent innovation and problem-solving.

Amazon Experience - Scalable Software Solutions:

Currently at Amazon, I develop high-quality, secure, scalable software solutions based on technical requirements. I work extensively with object-oriented programming using Java (Spring/SpringBoot) and Python, SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Git version control, REST APIs, and comprehensive unit testing frameworks (JUnit, Jest). My experience building systems that serve 100K+ daily users has taught me the discipline required for secure, production-grade software that powers critical business operations—exactly the level of quality and scale Mastercard's global payment systems demand.

I program, test, document, and maintain applications in adherence with Amazon's rigorous standards, processes, and best practices—standards comparable to Mastercard's own engineering excellence. My work includes comprehensive documentation practices ensuring code maintainability and knowledge transfer across geographically distributed teams, which is essential for Mastercard's global operations spanning 200+ countries.

Collaboration with Data Science & Product Teams:

At Amazon, I partner closely with Data Science and Product teams to identify business opportunities, solve problems, and deliver solutions. I've worked on data integration pipelines processing high-throughput data from DynamoDB to Amazon's Data Lake, requiring close collaboration with data scientists to understand requirements and deliver analytics-ready data. This experience directly translates to the Open Finance Analytics team's need for engineers who can bridge technical implementation with data-driven business insights.

I am skilled at explaining technical problems succinctly and clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Whether collaborating with product managers on feature requirements or working with data scientists on analytics integrations, I excel at translating complex technical concepts into actionable insights and vice versa.

Production Support & Distributed Teams:

I participate in on-call pager support rotation of Amazon's live services, handling production incidents, troubleshooting issues under pressure, and ensuring system reliability and uptime. This hands-on experience with production support has developed my incident management skills and taught me the importance of building robust, maintainable systems that minimize operational burden—critical for Mastercard's mission-critical payment infrastructure.

I work effectively as a member of geographically distributed project teams at Amazon, collaborating across multiple time zones with engineers, product managers, and stakeholders globally. My experience with distributed collaboration, asynchronous communication, and building alignment across teams positions me well for Mastercard's global engineering organization.

Continuous Innovation & Improvement:

I actively contribute ideas and look for opportunities to enhance team standards and improve efficiency. At Amazon, I led a JDK17 migration campaign across 28 packages, requiring me to identify opportunities for improvement, propose solutions, and drive adoption of best practices across teams. Prior to Amazon, at MAQ Software, I achieved 30% performance improvement through software optimization—demonstrating my passion for continuously improving software performance and efficiency.

I am intellectually curious and always looking for potential solutions to solve problems. My problem-solving approach combines analytical thinking with creative innovation, whether optimizing algorithms, architecting scalable systems, or improving development processes.

Golang & Technology Learning:

While my primary professional programming has been with Java, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript, I have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and software engineering concepts that translate well to learning new languages. I am highly eager to learn Golang and have a proven track record of quickly mastering new technologies—I've successfully learned and deployed GraphQL, various AWS services, React with TypeScript, and complex distributed systems architectures within tight timelines at Amazon.

My experience with Java provides a solid foundation for learning Go, as both languages emphasize performance, concurrency, and systems programming. I am committed to becoming proficient in Golang rapidly and contributing effectively to Mastercard's technology stack.

Why Mastercard:

Mastercard's mission to power economies and empower people worldwide resonates deeply with my values. The opportunity to work on Open Finance Analytics—helping build a sustainable economy where everyone can prosper—combines my technical skills with meaningful impact. I am particularly excited about contributing to digital payment innovations that make transactions secure, simple, smart, and accessible for millions of people globally.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my Amazon experience developing secure, scalable software solutions at scale, combined with my strong OOP foundation, REST API expertise, team collaboration skills, and eagerness to master Golang, can contribute to driving Mastercard's products forward. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Raghu Raj Sodani
Software Development Engineer
Amazon, Hyderabad
