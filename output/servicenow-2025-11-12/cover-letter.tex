Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.1in}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at ServiceNow. As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Hyderabad, I design and develop scalable, AI-enhanced software products that serve 100,000+ daily users with a strong emphasis on performance, reliability, and quality. With exactly 2.5 years of experience and proficiency in Python, Java, and React, I am excited about the opportunity to bring this experience to ServiceNow's mission of making the world work better for everyone.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Amazon Experience - Building at Scale:}

\vspace{0.1in}

Currently at Amazon, I design and develop scalable, maintainable, and reusable software components with strong emphasis on performance and reliability. I collaborate closely with product managers to translate requirements into well-architected solutions, owning features from design through delivery. My work includes building intuitive user experiences using React and modern UI frameworks while ensuring flexibility for customer-specific needs across our platform serving 100K+ daily users globally.

\vspace{0.1in}

One of my key contributions has been integrating automated testing into our development workflows. I work extensively with JUnit for Java components and have integrated comprehensive test strategies into our CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins. This ensures consistent quality across releases covering functional, regression, and integration aspects—directly aligning with ServiceNow's emphasis on software quality principles including reliability, observability, and production readiness.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Technical Leadership \& Quality Craftsmanship:}

\vspace{0.1in}

Beyond individual contributions, I actively participate in design and code reviews, ensuring best practices in performance, maintainability, and testability. I led a JDK17 migration campaign across 28 packages at Amazon, requiring me to troubleshoot complex systems and optimize performance across the stack. This initiative fostered a culture of continuous learning and improvement by sharing best practices in engineering and quality—a culture I see mirrored in ServiceNow's engineering organization.

\vspace{0.1in}

My strong knowledge of data structures, algorithms, object-oriented design, and design patterns enables me to architect clean, scalable solutions. Prior to Amazon, at MAQ Software, I achieved 30\% performance optimization through algorithmic improvements and design pattern implementation, demonstrating my commitment to performance optimization and software craftsmanship.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{AI Integration \& Modern Development:}

\vspace{0.1in}

I am particularly excited about ServiceNow's focus on AI-enhanced technology. At Amazon, I've been exploring how to integrate AI-powered tools into our development workflows and decision-making processes. I've worked with data pipelines that could support AI-driven insights and am eager to deepen my experience with AI validation, model predictions, and inference consistency as part of ServiceNow's AI-powered products.

\vspace{0.1in}

I am comfortable with development tools such as IDEs, debuggers, profilers, source control (Git), and Unix-based systems. My experience spans Python for backend services, Java with Spring for enterprise applications, and React for modern frontend development—the exact technology stack ServiceNow utilizes.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Why ServiceNow:}

\vspace{0.1in}

ServiceNow's mission to transform how we work through intelligent cloud-based platforms resonates deeply with my experience building systems that connect people, systems, and processes at Amazon. I am particularly drawn to your culture of engineering craftsmanship, quality, and innovation. The opportunity to build high-impact software that powers digital experiences for millions of users while working symbiotically with AI and automation tools aligns perfectly with my career aspirations and technical interests.

\vspace{0.1in}

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my Amazon experience delivering scalable, high-quality software products, combined with my proficiency in Python, Java, and React, can contribute to ServiceNow's continued success in delivering AI-enhanced technology to global enterprises. Thank you for considering my application.
