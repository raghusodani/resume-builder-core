Hiring Manager
Engineering Organization
ServiceNow
India

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at ServiceNow. As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Hyderabad, I design and develop scalable, AI-enhanced software products that serve 100,000+ daily users with a strong emphasis on performance, reliability, and quality. With exactly 2.5 years of experience and proficiency in Python, Java, and React, I am excited about the opportunity to bring this experience to ServiceNow's mission of making the world work better for everyone.

Amazon Experience - Building at Scale:

Currently at Amazon, I design and develop scalable, maintainable, and reusable software components with strong emphasis on performance and reliability. I collaborate closely with product managers to translate requirements into well-architected solutions, owning features from design through delivery. My work includes building intuitive user experiences using React and modern UI frameworks while ensuring flexibility for customer-specific needs across our platform serving 100K+ daily users globally.

One of my key contributions has been integrating automated testing into our development workflows. I work extensively with JUnit for Java components and have integrated comprehensive test strategies into our CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins. This ensures consistent quality across releases covering functional, regression, and integration aspects—directly aligning with ServiceNow's emphasis on software quality principles including reliability, observability, and production readiness.

Technical Leadership & Quality Craftsmanship:

Beyond individual contributions, I actively participate in design and code reviews, ensuring best practices in performance, maintainability, and testability. I led a JDK17 migration campaign across 28 packages at Amazon, requiring me to troubleshoot complex systems and optimize performance across the stack. This initiative fostered a culture of continuous learning and improvement by sharing best practices in engineering and quality—a culture I see mirrored in ServiceNow's engineering organization.

My strong knowledge of data structures, algorithms, object-oriented design, and design patterns enables me to architect clean, scalable solutions. Prior to Amazon, at MAQ Software, I achieved 30% performance optimization through algorithmic improvements and design pattern implementation, demonstrating my commitment to performance optimization and software craftsmanship.

AI Integration & Modern Development:

I am particularly excited about ServiceNow's focus on AI-enhanced technology. At Amazon, I've been exploring how to integrate AI-powered tools into our development workflows and decision-making processes. I've worked with data pipelines that could support AI-driven insights and am eager to deepen my experience with AI validation, model predictions, and inference consistency as part of ServiceNow's AI-powered products.

I am comfortable with development tools such as IDEs, debuggers, profilers, source control (Git), and Unix-based systems. My experience spans Python for backend services, Java with Spring for enterprise applications, and React for modern frontend development—the exact technology stack ServiceNow utilizes.

Why ServiceNow:

ServiceNow's mission to transform how we work through intelligent cloud-based platforms resonates deeply with my experience building systems that connect people, systems, and processes at Amazon. I am particularly drawn to your culture of engineering craftsmanship, quality, and innovation. The opportunity to build high-impact software that powers digital experiences for millions of users while working symbiotically with AI and automation tools aligns perfectly with my career aspirations and technical interests.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my Amazon experience delivering scalable, high-quality software products, combined with my proficiency in Python, Java, and React, can contribute to ServiceNow's continued success in delivering AI-enhanced technology to global enterprises. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Raghu Raj Sodani
Software Development Engineer
Amazon, Hyderabad
