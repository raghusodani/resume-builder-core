Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.1in}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Development Engineer 2 position on QuillBot's Growth Apps team. As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Hyderabad, I build scalable full-stack applications serving 100,000+ daily users using JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS, and NodeJS—the exact technology stack your position requires. I am excited about the opportunity to bring this experience to QuillBot's mission of helping 56 million people create great things.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Amazon Experience - Building at Scale:}

\vspace{0.1in}

Currently at Amazon, I design and develop end-to-end customer service systems using ReactJS with TypeScript frontends and Spring-based Java backends integrated with GraphQL APIs. This full-stack platform serves 100K+ daily users globally, requiring the same focus on performance, scalability, and quality that QuillBot's 56 million users demand. My work directly impacts user engagement and retention through data-driven features—exactly the growth-focused engineering that your team specializes in.

\vspace{0.1in}

One of my key projects involved architecting a data integration pipeline from DynamoDB to Amazon's Data Lake, incorporating transformation and validation layers to ensure data integrity across distributed systems. This experience building scalable backend infrastructure and working with large-scale data systems positions me well for QuillBot's growth initiatives around monetization, cross-sell features, and internationalization.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Technical Leadership \& Delivery:}

\vspace{0.1in}

Beyond individual contributions, I've demonstrated technical leadership at Amazon by leading a JDK17 migration campaign across 28 packages. This initiative required taking end-to-end ownership—from requirements gathering and design through implementation, testing, deployment, and monitoring—while collaborating with product managers, designers, and engineers across multiple teams. I contributed to engineering best practices through code reviews, testing strategies, and automation, directly mirroring the responsibilities you've outlined for this role.

\vspace{0.1in}

Prior to Amazon, I worked at MAQ Software where I led the migration of an enterprise application from AngularJS to React with TypeScript, achieving 30\% performance improvement. This experience taught me the importance of rapid iteration and experimentation in fast-paced environments—essential for growth engineering where you're constantly testing hypotheses and optimizing conversion metrics.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Why QuillBot:}

\vspace{0.1in}

I am particularly drawn to QuillBot's Growth Apps team because it combines my technical expertise in JavaScript/TypeScript/React/NodeJS with meaningful impact—helping students and professionals communicate effectively. Your focus on driving retention, monetization, and user growth through A/B experiments and data-informed features aligns perfectly with my experience building systems that directly influence user engagement at Amazon scale. I thrive in experiment-driven environments and understand that growth engineering requires both technical excellence and collaborative problem-solving with cross-functional stakeholders.

\vspace{0.1in}

Based in India and ready for hybrid/remote work, I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my Amazon experience building production-grade applications at scale, combined with my hands-on expertise in your exact tech stack, can help accelerate QuillBot's growth initiatives. Thank you for considering my application.
