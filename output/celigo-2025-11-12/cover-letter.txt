Hiring Manager
Backend Engineering Team
Celigo, Inc.
Hyderabad, India

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Backend Developer position for Celigo's integrator.io platform. As someone who is truly passionate about coding and solving complex integration challenges, I am excited about the opportunity to join a team pioneering the future of application integration and enabling independent best-of-breed applications to work together seamlessly.

Why I'm a Perfect Fit for Celigo:

With exactly 2.5+ years of relevant experience from product-based companies (Amazon and MAQ Software), I bring the technical proficiency and mindset that Celigo seeks. I am skilled in Node.js, MongoDB, and Amazon AWS—three of your core technology requirements. At Amazon, I designed and developed backend features for cloud integration platforms using Node.js and GraphQL APIs, integrating with AWS services to serve 100K+ daily users. I built a scalable data integration pipeline from DynamoDB to Data Lake, directly relevant to Celigo's mission of enabling seamless integrations between leading cloud applications.

My strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software design is evidenced by my Codechef 5-star rating (2040), placing me in the top 0.5% of competitive programmers globally. This demonstrates my exceptional problem-solving skills and ability to design simple, scalable solutions—exactly what Celigo values. Combined with my INMO 2019 scholarship and published research in optimization algorithms, I have proven my passion for continuous improvement and delivering results.

I have strong DevOps exposure with hands-on experience in CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, Docker containerization, and AWS infrastructure. I've collaborated closely with DevOps teams to ensure smooth deployment, high system reliability, and optimized performance—directly aligned with this role's responsibilities.

While I haven't worked directly with Apache Kafka yet, my fast learning ability and strong technical foundation enable me to quickly master new technologies. At Amazon, I successfully learned and implemented GraphQL integrations, data pipeline architectures, and cloud-native solutions within tight timelines, demonstrating my adaptability.

What Excites Me About Celigo:

I am particularly drawn to Celigo's mission of solving one of the biggest global SaaS problems—integrating cloud applications seamlessly. The opportunity to work on the integrator.io platform, enabling integrations between NetSuite, Salesforce, Amazon, and other leading cloud applications, aligns perfectly with my genuine interest in cloud technologies and product engineering. The challenge of building intelligent automation using modern AI technologies is exactly the kind of innovative work that motivates me.

I thrive in fast-paced environments with a strong ownership mindset. At Amazon, I proactively took initiative on complex projects, thinking big and collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams. I am excited about joining a company that values teamwork, creativity, and continuous learning, and I am particularly impressed by Celigo's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion through your Taking a Stand initiative.

Based in Hyderabad, I am ready to contribute immediately in either remote or hybrid capacity. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and passion for building scalable backend systems can contribute to Celigo's continued success in pioneering application integration.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Celigo's mission of making complex integrations just work.

Sincerely,

Raghu Raj Sodani
