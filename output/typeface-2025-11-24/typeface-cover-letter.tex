\textbf{Forward Deployed Engineer Position} \\
Typeface

\vspace{10pt}

Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Forward Deployed Engineer role at Typeface. Your mission to transform enterprise marketing through GenAI resonates deeply with me—I've spent my career building production systems that bridge technical complexity with real user impact, and I'm eager to apply this mindset to the cutting edge of generative AI.

\textbf{Why I'm a Strong Fit:}

\textbf{Full-Stack Engineering at Scale.} At Amazon, I've built production applications serving 100K+ users daily, reducing customer contacts by 12.7\% through a React + TypeScript + GraphQL platform. I've shipped features from requirements through deployment, working with Spring Boot, Node.js, and Python Django—exactly the stack Typeface requires. My experience rapidly prototyping solutions and iterating based on stakeholder feedback mirrors the fast experimentation mindset you're looking for.

\textbf{AI/ML Foundation Ready to Scale.} While my GenAI experience is still developing, I have solid fundamentals: I've worked with TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning, built data pipelines with transformation and validation layers, and collaborated with ISRO researchers on an AI-powered navigation system (published in Springer, 2022). My CodeChef 5-star rating (top 0.5\%) and mathematical olympiad background give me the problem-solving chops to master RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, and AI agent frameworks quickly. I'm actively exploring LangChain, vector databases, and Claude/GPT-4 APIs—I learn fast and I'm hungry to dive deep into this space.

\textbf{Customer-Centric Technical Consulting.} I've led cross-functional migrations across 28 packages, coordinated with enterprise stakeholders through technical workshops, and translated complex technical concepts for diverse audiences. At MAQ Software, I partnered directly with clients to define requirements and deliver solutions—building the trust and communication skills essential for a forward deployed role. I thrive in customer-facing environments where technical excellence meets business impact.

\textbf{Cloud, DevOps \& Integration Expertise.} I have hands-on AWS experience (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, EC2), work with Docker and CI/CD pipelines daily, and have built integrations with third-party systems through REST/GraphQL APIs with OAuth and JWT security. I understand the DevOps patterns needed to deploy scalable, enterprise-grade solutions with monitoring and compliance checks.

\textbf{Startup DNA \& Ownership Mentality.} Coming from Amazon's fast-paced culture and having led a full-stack migration at MAQ, I'm comfortable with ambiguity, wearing multiple hats, and tackling problems outside my core expertise. I ship iteratively, gather feedback aggressively, and focus on building quick wins that demonstrate momentum—exactly the experimentation mindset Typeface values.

\textbf{What Excites Me About Typeface:}

I'm genuinely energized by your vision of helping brands move from brief to campaign in days. The combination of multimodal AI (text, images, video), custom agent workflows, and enterprise integrations represents the most exciting frontier in software engineering today. The opportunity to work directly with customers, build proof points rapidly, and see my work transform marketing workflows is exactly the kind of high-impact role I'm seeking.

I'm also drawn to your team's pedigree (Microsoft, GV, Salesforce backing) and the chance to work at a startup building category-defining technology. Learning from world-class engineers while contributing to the GenAI platform roadmap through field-proven use cases is a career-accelerating opportunity.

\textbf{What I'll Bring Day One:}

Within my first 30 days, I'll ramp up on Typeface's API/SDK, Brand Hub, and Arc Agents while deepening my hands-on GenAI skills. I'll partner with Customer Success Managers to understand customer pain points and start building proof points that demonstrate quick wins. My full-stack expertise means I can immediately contribute to integrations, custom workflows, and technical workshops.

By 90 days, I'll be leading customer engagements independently—designing solutions, building prototypes, and translating field learnings back to Product teams. I'll develop reusable components and patterns while documenting playbooks that scale our delivery model.

I'd love to discuss how my full-stack background, customer-centric mindset, and eagerness to master GenAI can contribute to Typeface's growth. I'm ready to move fast, experiment boldly, and help enterprise customers unlock the power of AI-driven marketing.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Typeface's mission.
