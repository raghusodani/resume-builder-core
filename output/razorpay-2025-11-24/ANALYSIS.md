## 🎤 Interview Preparation

### **Key Questions to Expect**:

**1. "You're more full-stack. Why frontend engineer role?"**

**Answer**:
```
"While I've worked full-stack, my passion has always been frontend. At Amazon, 
the most fulfilling work was building the React customer service UI—translating 
designer mockups into pixel-perfect components, optimizing performance to hit 
40% improvement, and seeing users engage with what I built.

I want to go deeper on frontend: advanced React patterns, animation, micro-
frontend architectures, design systems. Razorpay's focus on payment UI—where 
every millisecond matters, every interaction must be perfect—aligns with what 
excites me most: building delightful, performant user interfaces.

My full-stack background is actually an advantage: I understand backend 
constraints, can design APIs that work well with frontend, and communicate 
effectively with backend teams."
```

---

**2. "Walk me through how you optimized performance by 40%"**

**Answer**:
```
"At Amazon, our customer service page had 5-second load times. Here's my approach:

1. **Profiling**: Used React DevTools Profiler + Chrome Lighthouse
   - Identified: Large bundle (3MB), unnecessary re-renders, no code splitting

2. **Code Splitting**: 
   - Implemented React.lazy() for route-based splitting
   - Reduced initial bundle from 3MB → 800KB

3. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Images: lazy loading with Intersection Observer
   - Below-fold components: loaded on scroll

4. **Component Optimization**:
   - React.memo() for expensive components
   - useMemo/useCallback to prevent re-renders
   - Virtual scrolling for long lists

5. **Bundle Analysis**:
   - Webpack Bundle Analyzer to find large dependencies
   - Replaced moment.js with date-fns (smaller)

Result: Load time 5s → 3s (40% improvement), LCP improved from 4s → 2s

Key lesson: Profile first, optimize based on data, measure impact."
```

---

**3. "How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility?"**

**Answer**:
```
"My approach:

1. **Development**:
   - Use modern ES6+ but transpile with Babel
   - CSS: Autoprefixer for vendor prefixes
   - Test in Chrome DevTools device mode

2. **Testing**:
   - Manual testing: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - BrowserStack for older versions if needed
   - Mobile: iOS Safari, Chrome Android

3. **Common Issues & Solutions**:
   - Flexbox: Use autoprefixer, test IE11 if required
   - CSS Grid: Fallbacks for older browsers
   - JavaScript APIs: Polyfills (e.g., Promise for old browsers)
   - Date handling: Avoid Safari date parsing issues

4. **Tools**:
   - Can I Use (caniuse.com) to check feature support
   - Babel for JS transpilation
   - PostCSS for CSS compatibility

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Progressive enhancement: Core functionality works everywhere
   - Graceful degradation: Advanced features for modern browsers
   - Feature detection over browser detection

At Amazon, we supported Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. Tested every release 
across all four to ensure consistency."
```

---

**4. "How do you collaborate with designers?"**

**Answer**:
```
"Collaboration approach:

1. **Early Involvement**:
   - Join design review meetings
   - Provide feedback on feasibility, performance implications
   - Suggest alternatives if design is technically complex

2. **Wireframe Review**:
   - Review Figma/Sketch designs
   - Flag unclear interactions, edge cases
   - Discuss responsive behavior (mobile, tablet, desktop)

3. **Component Mapping**:
   - Map designs to React components
   - Identify reusable patterns for component library
   - Discuss animation timing, transitions

4. **Implementation**:
   - Aim for pixel-perfect implementation
   - Use design tokens (colors, spacing) from design system
   - Share WIP for feedback (don't wait till done)

5. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Demo implementation to designer
   - Iterate based on feedback
   - Document any deviations and why

At Amazon, I worked with UX designer on customer service UI. We had weekly 
design syncs, Slack channel for quick questions, and shared Figma file with 
dev mode for specs.

Key: Respect design vision, but bring technical perspective. Designers 
appreciate when you flag performance issues early vs. building something 
that's slow."
```

---

**5. "What's your experience with accessibility?"**

**Answer**:
```
"At Amazon, implemented WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards:

1. **Semantic HTML**:
   - Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
   - Use <button> not <div onClick>
   - Form labels properly associated

2. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - All interactive elements focusable
   - Tab order logical
   - Escape to close modals
   - Enter/Space for buttons

3. **Screen Reader Support**:
   - ARIA labels where needed (aria-label, aria-describedby)
   - ARIA live regions for dynamic content
   - Skip navigation links

4. **Visual**:
   - Color contrast WCAG AA (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)
   - Focus indicators visible
   - Text resizable without breaking layout

5. **Testing**:
   - axe DevTools browser extension
   - NVDA/JAWS screen reader testing
   - Keyboard-only navigation testing

Example: Customer service form—ensured every field had proper label, error 
messages announced by screen readers, entire form navigable by keyboard.

For Razorpay, payments are critical—accessible UI means all users can pay, 
regardless of ability. Happy to champion this."
```

---

**6. "Show me your GitHub projects"**

**Answer**:
```
"Have several projects on github.com/raghusodani:

1. **ISRO Maritime System** (Most significant):
   - Real-time geospatial visualization
   - Django + JavaScript frontend
   - Interactive maps with real-time updates
   - Handled millions of data points

2. **React Side Projects** (Modern patterns):
   - React Hooks examples
   - State management patterns (Context, Redux)
   - API integration demos
   - Component libraries

3. **Open to Contributing**:
   - Haven't contributed to open-source extensively yet
   - Interested in contributing to React ecosystem
   - Would love guidance on where to start

Note: While full GitHub profile isn't public, happy to walk through code 
during technical interview or share specific repos.
