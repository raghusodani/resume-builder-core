Hiring Manager
Consumer and Community Banking Technology
JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Technology Division

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer II position within JPMorgan Chase's Consumer and Community Banking Technology team. As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Hyderabad with 2+ years of applied experience, I design and deliver secure, stable, and scalable software solutions that serve 100,000+ daily users. With demonstrable ability to code in Java Spring, Spring Boot, Microservices, and REST APIs, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to JPMorgan Chase's state-of-the-art technology products.

Amazon Experience - Enterprise Software Development:

Currently at Amazon, I execute software solutions through the design, development, and technical troubleshooting of multiple components within our technical products and systems. I write secure and high-quality code using Java Spring Boot with Microservices architecture, designing and developing systems with careful consideration of upstream and downstream systems and their technical implications. This work in Amazon's large corporate environment has given me hands-on practical experience in system design, application development, testing, and operational stability—exactly what JPMorgan Chase requires.

My work involves developing, debugging, and maintaining code in Amazon's large corporate environment using Java, Python, and database querying languages for both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (DynamoDB) systems. I've architected backend services serving 100K+ daily users, ensuring secure, stable application development through comprehensive testing and monitoring. This experience directly translates to JPMorgan Chase's need for engineers who can build resilient banking technology at scale.

Agile Methodologies & Modern Practices:

I have solid understanding and hands-on experience with agile methodologies including CI/CD, application resiliency, and security. At Amazon, I apply knowledge of tools within the Software Development Life Cycle toolchain to improve the value realized by automation. I maintain automated testing suites using JUnit integrated into our CI/CD pipelines through Jenkins, ensuring consistent quality across deployments. I actively work to reduce manual toil and improve development efficiency through automation.

My technical troubleshooting approach involves gathering, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from large, diverse data sets to identify problems and contribute to decision-making. I've architected data pipelines that process high-volume data from DynamoDB to Amazon's Data Lake, incorporating transformation and validation layers—experience that demonstrates my ability to work with complex data systems similar to those in banking technology.

Cloud Technologies & Full-Stack Capabilities:

I have strong exposure to AWS cloud technologies including EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS, and DynamoDB. I've designed and deployed cloud-native applications with focus on scalability and reliability. Additionally, I have familiarity with modern front-end technologies—specifically React with TypeScript—enabling me to contribute to full-stack solutions and understand the complete technical product from user interface through backend services to data storage.

Technical Leadership at Amazon:

Beyond individual contributions, I've demonstrated emerging leadership at Amazon by leading a JDK17 migration campaign across 28 packages. This initiative required coordinating with multiple teams in our large corporate environment, conducting code reviews, and advocating for best practices. I've learned and applied system processes, methodologies, and skills for the development of secure, stable code and systems, while contributing to a team culture of diversity, opportunity, inclusion, and respect.

Why JPMorgan Chase:

I am particularly drawn to JPMorgan Chase's Consumer and Community Banking Technology team because it offers the opportunity to work on technology products that directly impact millions of customers' financial lives. The combination of technical challenge—building secure, resilient banking systems at scale—and meaningful impact aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. I am excited about joining a firm that values innovation, technical excellence, and collaborative engineering culture.

My experience at Amazon has prepared me to thrive in JPMorgan Chase's environment. I understand the importance of security, stability, and operational excellence in large-scale systems. I am ready to contribute my skills in Java Spring Boot, REST APIs, system design, and cloud technologies while continuing to grow within the Software Engineer II role and advance my career at one of the world's leading financial institutions.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my Amazon experience building secure, scalable software solutions, combined with my technical expertise in your required stack and my collaborative approach, can contribute to JPMorgan Chase's mission of delivering state-of-the-art banking technology. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Raghu Raj Sodani
Software Development Engineer
Amazon, Hyderabad
