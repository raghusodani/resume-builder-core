Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.1in}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Engineer position developing financial products. As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Hyderabad, I have exactly 2.5 years of hands-on expertise building scalable systems using Java Spring Boot for RESTful APIs and React JS for responsive user interfaces, serving 100,000+ daily consumers. I am excited about the opportunity to develop financial products with direct impact on millions of consumers, bringing Amazon's ownership culture—where engineers build it, run it, and own it—to your organization.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Build It, Run It, Own It - Amazon's Ownership Culture:}

\vspace{0.1in}

Your philosophy of engineers controlling decisions from the first line of code, being responsible for operations, and not waiting for orders resonates deeply with my experience at Amazon. At Amazon, we embody the same ownership culture: I design and develop systems, make architectural decisions, research and pitch projects, deploy to production, and run operations with our global SRE team. When I identify opportunities to enhance systems or improve processes, I don't wait for permission—I research, propose solutions, and drive implementation. This autonomy and ownership is exactly how I thrive, and it's precisely what drew me to your role.

\vspace{0.1in}

I've led initiatives like a JDK17 migration across 28 packages at Amazon, requiring me to pitch the project, gain stakeholder buy-in, make technical decisions, and drive execution—demonstrating the ownership mindset your organization values. Great ideas being valued and implemented, rather than top-down mandates, is what makes engineering fulfilling.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Full-Stack Expertise - Java Spring Boot \& React JS:}

\vspace{0.1in}

I have 2.5 years of professional experience with your exact technology stack. On the backend, I design, develop, and maintain RESTful APIs and microservices using Java Spring Boot. I implement complex business logic, manage database interactions with both relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, DynamoDB), and integrate with third-party services. My systems serve as primary sources of functionality for 100K+ daily users, requiring optimization for performance and scalability—experience directly applicable to financial products that are primary revenue sources.

\vspace{0.1in}

On the frontend, I develop responsive and user-friendly interfaces using React with TypeScript and HTML5. I collaborate closely with UI/UX designers to implement seamless user experiences, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness. My full-stack capabilities allow me to own features end-to-end, from database schema design through API development to frontend implementation—delivering complete, polished products.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Distributed Systems \& Microservices Architecture:}

\vspace{0.1in}

I have strong experience with distributed systems, having built microservices at Amazon that handle high-traffic loads across distributed infrastructure. I work with transactional services ensuring data consistency, integrate with RESTful web services, and understand the challenges of building scalable, reliable systems. My experience architecting data pipelines processing high-throughput data across distributed systems gives me the foundation needed for financial products requiring reliability, consistency, and scale.

\vspace{0.1in}

I'm familiar with NoSQL and relational databases, having designed schemas, optimized queries for performance, and managed database operations in production. While I haven't worked directly with Kafka or vert.X, I understand distributed messaging patterns and am eager to master these technologies quickly—my track record shows rapid learning of new frameworks (GraphQL, various AWS services, complex distributed systems) within tight timelines.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{DevOps, Testing \& Agile:}

\vspace{0.1in}

I collaborate with DevOps teams deploying applications in AWS cloud environments using CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions). I write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests ensuring code quality and debug application issues promptly. Working in Agile operating models at Amazon, I've established trusted partnerships with product heads and stakeholders, translating business requirements into technical solutions and delivering measurable impact.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Financial Products Impact:}

\vspace{0.1in}

The opportunity to develop financial products with direct impact on millions of consumers, where systems under my watch would be primary revenue sources, is incredibly exciting. At Amazon, I've built systems serving 100K+ users where reliability and performance directly impact business outcomes—but the chance to work specifically on financial products that empower consumers economically takes this impact to another level. I am motivated by building products that make a tangible difference in people's lives.

\vspace{0.1in}

\textbf{Why This Role:}

\vspace{0.1in}

This position represents the ideal combination of ownership culture, technical challenge, and impact. Your philosophy that engineers research, pitch projects, make decisions, and own systems resonates perfectly with how I've operated at Amazon and what I value most in engineering work. The opportunity to build financial products using my exact tech stack (Java Spring Boot + React JS) while working with influential people across a global organization aligns perfectly with my career aspirations.

\vspace{0.1in}

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my Amazon experience building and owning full-stack systems at scale, combined with my expertise in Java, Spring Boot, React JS, distributed systems, and microservices architecture, can contribute to developing impactful financial products. Thank you for considering my application.
