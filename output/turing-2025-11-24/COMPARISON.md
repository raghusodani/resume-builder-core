## Content Differences

### **What Was Removed:**
1. ❌ Foxmula internship (Oct 2021-Jul 2022)
   - Reason: Oldest internship, less relevant for senior role
   - Impact: Freed ~4 lines of space

2. ❌ Verbose experience bullets
   - Before: 4-5 bullets per job
   - After: 2-4 bullets per job (most impactful)

3. ❌ Extended soft skills section
   - Before: Separate section with detailed description
   - After: Integrated into Tools & Practices

4. ❌ Detailed project descriptions
   - Before: 3 bullets for ISRO project
   - After: 2 bullets (most relevant)

### **What Was Kept:**
✅ All JD keywords (business intelligence, stakeholder communication, etc.)  
✅ All quantified achievements (100K+ users, 30%, 12.7%)  
✅ Python/TypeScript/JavaScript emphasis  
✅ AI/ML skills section  
✅ Research collaboration (ISRO project)  
✅ All achievements (CodeChef, INMO, publication)  
✅ Amazon SDE current role (all 4 bullets)

### **Turing (Single-page)**:
```
Full-stack developer with 4+ years of experience in Python, JavaScript, 
and TypeScript. Proven expertise in building scalable AI-driven solutions 
serving 100K+ users, optimizing performance through algorithmic improvements, 
and collaborating with cross-functional teams and researchers. Strong 
problem-solving abilities (CodeChef 5-star) with published research in 
optimization algorithms.
```

**Improvements**:

## Which One to Use?

### **Use 2-Page Version When:**
- Role requires extensive detail
- Senior/principal level positions
- Research-heavy positions
- Company values comprehensive background

### **Use Single-Page Version When:** ✅ **RECOMMENDED FOR TURING**
- ✅ ATS systems prefer single page
- ✅ Recruiters spend <30 seconds on first scan
- ✅ Remote/contract roles (Turing model)
- ✅ Early-stage screening processes
- ✅ Multiple applications (easier to tailor)

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**For Turing Application: Use Single-Page Version** ✅

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ Turing uses ATS screening
2. ✅ Contract/remote model favors concise resumes
3. ✅ Assessment-based hiring (resume is just first filter)
4. ✅ All key information preserved
5. ✅ Better readability
6. ✅ Matches format of other successful applications (Rubrik)
